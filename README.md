A a customer, I would like to;

2. Choose what kind of crust I would like the pizza to have e.g Crispy, Stuffed, Gluten-free
3. Choose the topping(s) I want on my pizza.
4. Place an order for my Pizza and see the total charge for it.
5. Have an option to order as many pizzas as I want.
6. Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered I want to be alerted how much the delivery charge will be.
7. If I want my pizza to be delivered, I want to be prompted to enter where the delivery should be made and an alert saying '' your order will be delivered to your location"
8. See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.
