A a customer, I would like to;

2. Choose what kind of crust I would like the pizza to have e.g Crispy, Stuffed, Gluten-free
3. Choose the topping(s) I want on my pizza.
4. Place an order for my Pizza and see the total charge for it.
5. Have an option to order as many pizzas as I want.
6. Have an option to have the pizza delivered or not.  If delivered I want to be alerted how much the delivery charge will be.
7. If I want my pizza to be delivered, I want to be prompted to enter where the delivery should be made and an alert saying '' your order will be delivered to your location"
8. See a checkout button that when clicked shows the total amount charged for the orders.

#### **PROJECT OBJECTIVES**
1. The project code uses constructors in Javascript.
2. The project makes use of prototypes in Javascript.
3. The project implements one or more Javascript functions.
4. The project separates the business logic code from the UI logic code.
5. The web app uses bootstrap and media queries to make it fully responsive.
6. The javascript code uses the correct syntax of camel case naming of variables. I.e var myVariable = "stores something"; instead of var my_var = "stores something", or, var MyVar = "stores something" , or,  var my-Var = "stores something"

#### **REQUIREMENTS**
## **PIZZA PLACE WEB APP.**
1. Determine the prices for each pizza size.
2. Each pizza topping should have a set value depending on the size of the pizza.
3. Determine the cost for the crust
4. The total cost of a pizza should constitute, the crust, topping(s) and size of the pizza.
